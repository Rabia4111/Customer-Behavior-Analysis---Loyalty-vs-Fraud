# Customer Behavior Analysis: Loyalty vs Fraud

This project analyses a synthetic e-commerce customer data set to learn about customer loyalty patterns, fraud detection patterns, and churn risk patterns. It involves the cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Python with Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:
[E-Commerce Customer Analytics – Loyalty vs Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahilislam007/e-commerce-customer-analytics-loyalty-vs-fraud)

## Project Structure

* Load and inspect the dataset
* Handle missing values
* Create new features like customer tenure
* Encode categorical variables
* Visualize key patterns and relationships
* Analyze fraud, churn risk, and loyalty behavior

## Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

Open the notebook file:

```
ecommerce_customer_EDA.ipynb
```

and run each cell in order.

## Output

The notebook includes visualizations such as fraud counts, churn risk distributions, loyalty scatter plots, and a correlation heatmap to support business insights.
